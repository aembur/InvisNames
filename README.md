# InvisNames

This was originally going to be a part of my [HealthTags](https://github.com/aembur/HealthTags) mod, but it was out of scope for what that mod was doing, so this is now a separate mod.

## Installation
1. Install the latest [Forge](https://files.minecraftforge.net/net/minecraftforge/forge/index_1.12.2.html) for 1.12.2
2. Get the latest version of the mod from the [releases](https://github.com/aembur/InvisNames/releases) page
3. Put the file in your `.minecraft/mods` folder
